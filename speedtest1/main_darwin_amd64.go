// In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 30 integer
// [result codes].  However, experience has shown that many of
// these result codes are too coarse-grained.  They do not provide as
// much information about problems as programmers might like.  In an effort to

// and later) include
// support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
// about errors. These [extended result codes] are enabled or disabled
// on a per database connection basis using the
// [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()] API.  Or, the extended code for
// the most recent error can be obtained using
// [sqlite3_extended_errcode()].

// CAPI3REF: Flags For File Open Operations
//
// These bit values are intended for use in the
// 3rd parameter to the [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface and
// in the 4th parameter to the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method.

// Reserved:                         0x00F00000

// CAPI3REF: Device Characteristics
//
// The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the [sqlite3_io_methods]
// object returns an integer which is a vector of these
// bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage
// device that holds the file that the [sqlite3_io_methods]
// refers to.
//
// The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
// any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
// mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
// are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
// nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
// that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
// first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
// way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
// information is written to disk in the same order as calls
// to xWrite().  The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that
// after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a
// file that were written at the application level might have changed
// and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are
// guaranteed to be unchanged.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN
// flag indicates that a file cannot be deleted when open.  The
// SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on
// read-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with
// elevated privileges.
//
// The SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC property means that the underlying
// filesystem supports doing multiple write operations atomically when those
// write operations are bracketed by [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] and
// [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE].

// CAPI3REF: File Locking Levels

// SQLite uses one of these integer values as the second
// argument to calls it makes to the xLock() and xUnlock() methods
// of an [sqlite3_io_methods] object.

// CAPI3REF: Synchronization Type Flags
//
// When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an
// [sqlite3_io_methods] object it uses a combination of
// these integer values as the second argument.
//
// When the SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the
// sync operation only needs to flush data to mass storage.  Inode
// information need not be flushed. If the lower four bits of the flag
// equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
// If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means
// to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
//
// Do not confuse the SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags
// with the [PRAGMA synchronous]=NORMAL and [PRAGMA synchronous]=FULL
// settings.  The [synchronous pragma] determines when calls to the
// xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
// The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how
// energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and
// only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
// (Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction
// between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the
// operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX
// cares about the difference.)

// CAPI3REF: OS Interface Open File Handle
//
// An [sqlite3_file] object represents an open file in the

// CAPI3REF: Synchronization Type Flags
//
// When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an
// [sqlite3_io_methods] object it uses a combination of
// these integer values as the second argument.
//
// When the SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the
// sync operation only needs to flush data to mass storage.  Inode
// information need not be flushed. If the lower four bits of the flag
// equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
// If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means
// to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
//
// Do not confuse the SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags
// with the [PRAGMA synchronous]=NORMAL and [PRAGMA synchronous]=FULL
// settings.  The [synchronous pragma] determines when calls to the
// xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
// The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how
// energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and
// only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
// (Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction
// between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the

// Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
// [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
// [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
// This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
// against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
//
// If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
// may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
// only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
// is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
// to NULL.
//
// The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
// [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
// The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
// flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
// and not its inode needs to be synced.
//
// The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
// <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
// </ul>
// xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
// The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
// either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
// PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
// if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
//
// The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
// VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
// [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
// integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
// point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
// write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
// functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
// locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
// about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
// core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
// A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
// Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
// greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
// return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
// recognize.
//
// The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
// device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
// minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
// other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
// method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
// underlying device:
//
// <ul>
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC1K]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC2K]

// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE]
// <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC]
// </ul>
//
// The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
// any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
// mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
// are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
// nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
// that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
// first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
// way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
// information is written to disk in the same order as calls
// to xWrite().
//
// If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill
// in the unread portions of the buffer with zeros.  A VFS that
// fails to zero-fill short reads might seem to work.  However,
// failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to
// database corruption.

// 7.18.4 Macros for integer constants

// 7.18.2 Limits of specified-width integer types:
//   These #defines specify the minimum and maximum limits
//   of each of the types declared above.
//
//   They must have "the same type as would an expression that is an
//   object of the corresponding type converted according to the integer
//   promotion".

// 7.18.2.1 Limits of exact-width integer types

//
//       Note:  the literal "most negative int" cannot be written in C --
//       the rules in the standard (section 6.4.4.1 in C99) will give it
//       an unsigned type, so INT32_MIN (and the most negative member of
//       any larger signed type) must be written via a constant expression.
//

// 7.18.2.2 Limits of minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.3 Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.4 Limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers

// 7.18.2.5 Limits of greatest-width integer types

// 7.18.3 "Other"

// WCHAR_MIN should be 0 if wchar_t is an unsigned type and
//    (-WCHAR_MAX-1) if wchar_t is a signed type.  Unfortunately,
//    it turns out that -fshort-wchar changes the signedness of
//    the type.
